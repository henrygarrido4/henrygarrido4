After picking up my first programming book "November - 2023" I decided to take on this new endevour so here is are some projects I took on and some other small little challenges I have completed. Now I enjoy engaging in random conversations with people from all walks of life, always seeking to learn something new or find something interesting. The unknown and new adventures excite me. My curiosity and desire to help others have driven me to become an autodidact, which has helped me advance in technology. I decided to start creating my own projects, helping the people around me achieve their personal goals and dreams. I have become very proficient in the basics and fundamentals of Computer Science, utilizing HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python and MySQL.
